# Building-Intuition-For-DNS


In this Repo, I aim to show you and simplify the concept of DNS (Domain Name System) for an easier grasp of understanding it. We will cover topics such as DNS A-Records, the creation and deletion of records, CNAME Records, and Root Hints.


<h2>Environments and Technologies</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (Mac) (RDP)
- Command Line
- Microsoft Azure Active Directory (On-premises)
- Domain Name System (DNS)

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

If you have completed https://github.com/Emq17/Configuring-On-premises-Active-Directory-within-Azure-VMs without closing out your session, you are good to go.
- If starting from scratch:
  - Client VM joined to your Domain
  - MicroSoft Azure w/ two pre-configured VM's
  - Client-01 and DC-1 Virtual Machines
  - MircoSoft Active Directory installed in DC-1
  - DC-1 promoted to a Domain Controller

<h2>Overview (What We're Going To Do)</h2>

1. Inspect DNS A-Records on the server (hostname to IP address mappings)
2. Create some of our own A-Records on the server and observe them from the client
3. Delete records from server and inspect/clear the client DNS cache to gain understanding
4. Touch on "CNAME" records (mapping one name to another name)
5. Discuss Root Hints: If you're using our local DNS server to resolve names into IP addresses, why can we go to Google and all the rest of the sites on the internet? Does our local DNS saerver know about those?

<h2>A-Records</h2>

A-Records are mappings from Host Names to IP Addresses

- Using the same credentials from https://github.com/Emq17/Configuring-On-premises-Active-Directory-within-Azure-VMs, go ahead and use Microsoft Remote Desktop to log into DC-1 as your domain admin account (mydomain.com\jane_admin)
- Connect and log into Client-1 as an admin (jane_admin)
  - From Client-1 try to ping "mainframe" and notice that it fails to do so

- This currently represents what took place behind the scenes on why we are getting the error message in our Command Prompt
  - It couldn't find a record in our cache, host file, or local DNS server

- Switch over to DC-1 so we can get started on creating an A-Record for mainframe ("mainframe" is just a random name, we could have chosen "zebra" if we really wanted to)
- Go into your Server Manager dashboard and click on "Tools" and then "DNS" from the drop down menu

- Click and expand "DC-1".
  - Forward Lookup Zone: Host Name to IP address mapping
  - Reverse Lookup Zone: IP Address to Host Name mapping
- Expand "Forward Lookup Zone" and click on "mydomain.com"
  - You should now see the list of A-Records that we have right now
- Remember that an A-Record just means host name to IP address mapping
  - So you can see Client-1 as a Host Name and it maps to 10.0.0.5 while dc-1 is another Host Name that maps to 10.0.0.4 
- These automatically got registered over the network when Client-1 went online. DNS is integrated within Active Directory

- Manaully create another A-Record for the host name "mainframe"
  - Right click and click on "New Host (A or AAAA)..."

![Screen Shot 2023-12-23 at 7 10 58 PM](https://github.com/Emq17/Building-Intuition-For-DNS/assets/147126755/72d4ee7a-92f5-4cfa-b6b5-6ed9afd30bb5)

- Fill out the name and go ahead and choose dc-1's IP address then click "Add Host"
    - Essentially what we are doing right now is arbitrary. We are just randomly creating an A-Record so we can observe what happens on Client-1 when we do this

- As you can see we have successfully created an A-Record for mainframe
  - Now we can go back to Client-1 and try to ping mainframe again

- You can see here that the ping succeeds this time

![Screen Shot 2023-12-23 at 7 20 40 PM](https://github.com/Emq17/Building-Intuition-For-DNS/assets/147126755/062e2b83-26a2-41a6-ac79-bb1196546b83)

- Type in "nslookup mainframe" on your command line
  - Observe how the dc-1 server with the 10.0.0.4 IP address was able to return the record "mainframe.mydomain.com"

<h1>ALL DONE!!! CONGRATS!!!</h1>
<h3>Now you have a better understanding of DNS, A-Records, DNS caching and CNAME Records. </h3>
